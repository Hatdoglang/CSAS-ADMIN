"Negative","Not recommended. Showers not working, only cold bucket water. No toilet seat. No flushing toilet, bucket only. No bathroom sink. Nasty breakfast. Only 1 fake meat option. No juice. No coffee.
Lots of noise & people from day use. I was the only one staying overnight & never was i greeted or asked how everything was. Garbage & breakfast dishes were not cleaned up for my entire stay."
"Positive","Beach - fine white sand, clear waters, but since it is located within a cove, there is little waves only.
Cottage. P4000 good for 5 adults. 3 single beds and 2 exra bed. Room is clean and spacious. P300 per pax for addtl persons. CR is big. Aircon is functioning and they have water tv, water dispenser inside the room. With private ihawan and hugasan ng pinggan at the back of your cottage.
Area. Big property, clean, and quiet. Videoke is not allowed.
Breakfast is included in the room for 5 people. Silog food is served for breakfast.
Friendly and helpful staff. They even let us borrow their rice cooker.
Overall, our stay is worth it."
"Positive","Superb! They have one of the best sunset we've ever seen. Crystal clear water, child friendly resort, calm beach and friendly staff. A place where you can relax and enjoy."
"Neutral","â­• Nice view especially at night.
â­• Good for family picnic although the rent of the cottage may be a bit ""pricey"" (750 pesos in our case).
â­• Has a lot to improve especially service and policies regarding reservation (understandable since this is still a young resort)"
"Positive","Enjoyed swimming at Bahia because the Beach was nice and quiet plus the the sand was sure fine. The rates were affordable as well. ðŸ’¯"
