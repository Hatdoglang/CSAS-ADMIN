"Positive","I like how this place is serene, tranquil and clean. You can see some surfers here too. The place is affordable and you can also walk through the shoreline.

No review for rooms since we only went daytour.
Perhaps no WIFI, the internet connection is also weak but you can still find areas where signal is available.

ENTRANCE : P60/head Daytour
COTTAGE: 600"
"Negative","The place is a nightmare for those wanting relaxation and access to a good beach - no wifi, communal comfort rooms, poor accommodation. The beach itself is overrated and you struggle to swim with huge corals and stones underneath. Try bringing out friends who are loud, the kind who have tattoos, women with revealing clothes, or members of the LGBT community and you are guaranteed piercing looks from the locals. The food is too salty.

For couples - the ""kubo"" isn't really soundproof so you might want to consider.

For groups - beach front is very limited so drinks with music and food may be done elsewhere (nearby beaches).

Pros: Night life is decent and the City itself is nice for a joy ride with great views. City vibe just feels different - homey, relaxing, and peaceful."
"Positive","It is my third time here. Their service is superb! You really feel like you are home. Love the place, the sand and their hospitality. They let you borrow utensils hehehe and they are considerate too to the rates. They offer affordable rooms with AC or non-AC accommodation."
"Negative","Pros: high water pressure, nice toilet and bath/shower, you can swim in other resorts' waters.

Cons: staff almost do not want visitors. They talk to visitors with a seeming assumption that they will be cheated and guests will not pay. Super unprofessional and unapproachable. Coffee is â‚±15 in menu, â‚±20 on posted sign, and â‚±25 when you order. Small ice is â‚±10. Not allowed to shower in comfort room but shower room has no door and you're left to doing your shower stuff for the whole world to see. One of the comfort rooms has no lock and the other is not clean. Night swimming is not allowed. No flat space to set up a tent. The water has large rocks that will throw anyone off-balance. These rocks were put there and not a natural occurrence."
"Positive","Such  cozy place. Personally, I liked it here. It's perfect for family bonding or friends get together. The place is small, and their open Kubo cottages also small. I think around 5 to 8 persons can seat in their Kubo cottages. If you want to have a big party, don't get a cottage. ðŸ˜… They have aircon rooms, family rooms and an open function hall too. Their grilling station is really nice and clean. Their shower area is good, but toilet for female is just 2 to 3 cubicles ðŸ˜… Well, we still had a good experience in this resort. It gets fully booked on weekends ðŸ˜… Better have your reservation ahead of time."
